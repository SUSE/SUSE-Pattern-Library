## This is the SUSE Pattern Library project 

Created as a *reference implementation* of recommended common SUSE styles and components.

Intended for both products and online properties depending on the pattern.

SUSE-PL is not designed to be a replacement for existing frameworks and aims to make it as easy as possible to cherry pick useful code.

All CSS is prefixed `.suse-pl` so as not to break your site when importing.

The repository is HTML, CSS and, vanilla js.

To browse, just open a .html file and enjoy.

helper utilities are in the utils directory and

For feeedback and discussion please join #network-design-cop on slack.
